 * Mid-flight migration flag.

 *     if (yield* patched('add-auth-check')) {
 *       // new behavior
 *     } else {
 *       // old behavior, kept for runs started before the patch
 *     }
 *
 * Returns `true` for runs that were started under a workflow version
 * which declared `patches: ['add-auth-check', ...]`, `false` for runs
 * started before the patch existed. The decision is read from the
 * run's persisted `startingPatches` field — stable across replays.
 *
 * Workflows that use `patched()` must declare the patch names on the
 * workflow definition so new runs see them at start:
 *
 *     defineWorkflow({
 *       name: 'pipeline',
 *       patches: ['add-auth-check'],
 *       run: async function* () { ... }
 *     })
 *
 * Declaring `patches` also switches the workflow into patch-versioned
 * fingerprint mode — code-body changes no longer trigger
 * `workflow_version_mismatch`. Hosts running multiple versions side-by-
 * side should pair this with `selectWorkflowVersion`.
 *
 * Slated for deprecation: a follow-up design pass replaces this with
 * explicit `version` + `previousVersions` routing on the workflow
 * definition. Kept for v0 to preserve the current engine behavior.
