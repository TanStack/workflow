   * Caveat: not all side effects are safe to time out. Aborting a
   * non-idempotent operation mid-flight can leave external state in
   * an inconsistent place. Use `ctx.id` as an idempotency key when
   * the target system supports it, or wrap the step in a server-side

 *       })
 *       return res.json()
 *     })
 *
 * Semantics:
 *
 *  - On first execution, the engine runs `fn`, persists the resulting
 *    value to the run's step log, and resumes the generator with the
 *    return value.
 *  - On replay (process restart, multi-instance routing), the engine
 *    short-circuits this yield with the recorded result and `fn` is NOT
 *    invoked again.
 *  - `ctx.id` is a deterministic per-step ID — use it as an idempotency
 *    token with external systems so a retried step (engine crash
 *    between execute and persist) doesn't double-trigger the side
 *    effect.
 *
 * If `fn` throws, the rejection propagates back into the workflow
 * generator as a normal `throw` — user code may catch it. The failure
 * is persisted as a log entry with an `error` field; on replay the
 * recorded error is rethrown so user-side catch logic replays
 * identically.
 *
 * Determinism contract: `fn` may do anything (I/O, randomness, time),
 * but its return value should be stable enough that subsequent
 * generator logic depending on it stays deterministic across replays.
 * The engine doesn't enforce this — replay sees only the recorded
 * return value.
